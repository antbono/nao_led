# nao_led

This package is part of the [Open Access NAO](https://github.com/antbono/OAN) framework.

It manages NAO v6 leds through the [nao_lola](https://github.com/ros-sports/nao_lola) package from [ROS Sports](https://ros-sports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Main features

At the moment, you can exploit the package for the following activities:

- *Switch on/off any led*

- *Blinking any led with the desired frequency*

- *Turn LEDs on or off so as to show a 'rotating' animation*
